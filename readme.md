## TODO:

an actual readme \
page after a quote is submitted \
validation checks on submitted jokes - limit to tweet length? \
page for viewing more than one quote at a time - pagination / 10 jokes in chronological order? score order? both? \
share page - tweet? maybe an api for loading the quote in an image to instagram \
report a joke - either just a json of quotes to check or email/message to me \
link to repo? portfolio? \
\
REFACTOR - focus on DRY espec in the models \
Routing? Probably not necessary at this scale \
Responsive? Switch html page to a mobile friendly scale. might already mostly be since it's so basic \
Non-500 error handling \
testing for validation etc. \
styles in .css file? \
