## ideas

// user submit quotes / author - post submit page

// voting on quotes - page for this

// sort by score, new

// share

//
TODO:
page after a quote is submitted
validation checks on submitted jokes
page for viewing more than one quote at a time - pagination / 10 jokes in chronological order? score order? both?
share page - tweet? maybe an api for loading the quote in an image to instagram
Submit a new joke - link from homepage
report a joke - either just a json of quotes to check or email/message to me

REFACTOR
Routing? Probably not necessary at this scale
Responsive? Switch html page to a mobile friendly scale. might already be since it's so basic
Non-500 error handling
testing for validation etc.
styles in .css file?
