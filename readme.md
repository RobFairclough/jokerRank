## TODO:

an actual readme \
page after a quote is submitted \
validation checks on submitted jokes - limit to tweet length? \
page for viewing more than one quote at a time - pagination / 10 jokes in chronological order? score order? both? \
report a joke - either just a json of quotes to check or email/message to me \
\
REFACTOR - focus on DRY espec in the models \
Routing? Probably not necessary at this scale \
Responsive? Switch html page to a mobile friendly scale. might already mostly be since it's so basic \
Non-500 error handling \
testing for validation etc. \
styles in .css file? \

PSQL TODO: \
add data \
functions for adding a joke: if author exists attribute joke to author, else create author \
functions for viewing jokes, by author, score, etc. \
function for removing a joke \
voting \
maybe routing \
branch for implementing
